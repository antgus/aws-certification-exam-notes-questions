    - can be distributed across AZs.

- Primary shard and Replica shards can be split across different AZs for reliability
- Loading data using lambda: 
    - post data in cloudwatch logs
    - use lambda to load from cloudwatch to firehose
    - lambda decorator processes firehose with additional data (e.g. when processing VPC flow logs)

    - then firehose sends data to elasticsearch.
